## Unofficial BugMeNot Chrome Extension

[BugMeNot](bugmenot.com) is a web service that provides you public login usernames and passwords for you to access certain websites, so you can now watch, for example, Channel4 VOD without register yourself! With the unofficial extension it's super easy, just click the icon and you are ready to go!

You can use this app with your own [kimonolabs](kimonolabs.com) API Key. Just add it to app.js > var api_key.
